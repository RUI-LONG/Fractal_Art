## Julia Set 

To compute a Julia set, put z to the coordinate of the current point and with c a constant.  <br>
Then you'll get a different Julia set for each value of c. ( where there is only a single Mandelbrot set.)

## Computation
J  is the unit matrix with the same dimensions as Z. <br>
c = -0.143+0.65i <br>
Z(t+1)=Z(t)âˆ—Z(t)+cJ,
